* About dot-usr

'dot-usr' is (or will be) a build tree for software packages roughly
analogous to the BSD port collections, but much simpler in
implementation (but less comfortable in use).

At the moment this collection only serves my personal needs. I'm only
putting in online because 

  - I need the software at multiple sites 
  - there is nothing really secret in these scripts
  - I'm loath the duplicate the effort

ATM ([2013-10-03 Thu]) there is no installation guide ./INSTALL, and
./NOTES is empty: Some time in future, though, you might find more
information there.

Please note the [[LICENSE (GPL 3)]].
