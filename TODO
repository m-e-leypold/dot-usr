* Open Points

  - [ ] There should be a setup/configure script
    - Put default files in installation root (README, Makefile, Profile, link to src).
    - bootstrap, local etc should be subdirs and git repos.
    - roots different

  - [ ] Different installs in one system (basically means: Messing
    with the variable names like DOTUSR_ROOT).

  - [ ] Config.sh and friends should be smart enough to use the
    profile in env, if there is one or else run/eval dot-usr.profile.
